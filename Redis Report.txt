Redis report:

What does this technology do for us.

This is an open source framework used with django channels that is a
memory data backing store for messages. It supports the instant messaging
application in this project by allowing the messages to go this Redis layer.

How does this technology accomplish what it does.

Redis accomplishes being a memory back store for messages as you institute
it your settings.py part of the project. From there you institute the Redis
layer in the CHANNEL_LAYERS which allows you to talk between different instances
of an application. The layer then uses Redis as its backing store and supports
both a single-server and sharded configurations
