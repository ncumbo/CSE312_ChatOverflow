What does this technology do for us.

This is an open source framework used with django channels and JavaScript
that decorates a regular WebSocket connection into one that will automatically
reconnect if the connection is dropped. We use this in out project to keep an
ongoing connection in instant messages.

How does this technology accomplish what it does.

This application is easy accomplished as all we'll need to do to accomplish a
reconnecting WebSocket is by replacing 'var ws = new WebSocket' to
'var ws = new ReconnectingWebSocket' in the javascript to the messaging.html
template. After doing this, we will add a script tag with the src going to the
reconnecting-websocket.js file.

The reconnecting-websocket.js file basically works like a WebSocket until it fails
to connect or gets disconnected, then it will repearedly poll until it successfully
connects again.
