Django report:

What does this technology do for us.

This is an open source framework used with python for web applications.
Django makes backend development much easier by processing HTTP requests
for us. It takes the requests and makes the respnonses based off of
templates we have setup. It handles backend TCP server action
to save time on creating it from the ground up.
 
How does this technology accomplish what it does.

For handling HTTP requests and sending responses it takes in the request 
in urls.py then sends them to views.py where it handles the request and 
gives HTTP responses and getting data from models.py when needed. 
Models contain objects the define behavior of the application. This all
comes together with an html template. The views can create a page off the 
html template and fill it with the data from the models.

Now django also has built in database features so we can avoid dealing
with heavy sql code. Running migrate sets up tables in the database based off
the content you placed in settings.py. Creating the models will be the database loadout.

Django also uses websockets through django channels to update pages without a refresh.
