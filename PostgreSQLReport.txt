PostgreSQL Report:

What does this technology do for us.

This is a database hosting service that integrates with Django to be used for storing user data
without the need for heavy SQL code. The database it creates stores all of the user information
(posts, account, media) inputted on the site. This allows us to present information stored for
individual users with simple commands in our code.


How does this technology accomplish what it does.

An SQL database can be integrated with Django in the backend of a Django python project.
In the settings.py file in our Django environment, the parameters are set to integrate an
ElephantSQL database with a key and password specific to our site. Running 'makemigrations' in Django
terminal will automatically create new database columns for user info to be stored. All communication between
the site and the database is handled by Django.
