Bootstrap report:

What does this technology do for us.

Bootstrap is a CSS framework that helps in making responsive apps.
We used this framework to make our website more beautiful and responsive.
We used for the nav bar and for aspects like tables and buttons, this 
gives our site more functionality and more intuitive.

How does this technology accomplish what it does.

Bootstrap is a collection of code written in HTML CSS and javascript.
It is a web framework that adds responsive elements. You can link the stylesheets
in the html and use the framework throughout. Buttons are from 
https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/buttons/
and are used the make them more responsive and beautiful.

That link is to the github that has uses of bootstrap.
Every page has our nav bar at the top to cycle through the pages. Taken from 
https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/navbar/
This sets up links between every html page in a responsive way. 
In the friends page there is a table that uses bootstrap to make it
more pleasing and intuitive 
https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/content/tables/
With all these elements it makes it easier to add responsive elements 
instead of having to type out hundreds of lines to accomplish the same task.
