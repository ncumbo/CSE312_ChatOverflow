Django Channels report:

What does this technology do for us.

This is an open source framework used with Redis that handles
asynchronous/synchronous WebSocket connections. It supports the
instant messaging application in this project by allowing the
messages to be sent through a channel that connects, disconnects,
retrieves, and sends messages through a WebSocket.

How does this technology accomplish what it does.

Django Channels works to support instant messaging through WebSockets
by Routing and Consumers. In order to do this, our WSGI application
must be turned into a ASGI (Asynchronous) application to run the channels
themselves. The consumers.py file contains functions that handle connecting,
disconnecting, recieving messages, and sending messages all through WebSockets.
The routing.py files act like urls.py but serve WebSocket url paths that
are connected to a the instant messaging consumer
